STOP: YOU MUST DOWNLOAD HOTKEYNET FOR THIS TO WORK!

PUT IT IN YOUR WOW DIR.
                    --YOU WILL BE BANNED--
DON'T MULTIBOX IN RETAIL IF YOU HAVE HKN ON YOUR COMPUTER!!!!
REMOVE BEFORE PLAYING RETAIL. ONLY USE 5MMB RETAIL, JMB, or some other legal
solution.

HOW TO RUN 5-Minute Multiboxing:
BEFORE STARTING:
10 LANGUAGE SUPPORT: (classic) Your GSE macros may get translated, they may not. Check
when you start leveling. If they do get translated, you may have to remove
(rank x) from them to get them to work. Look at them ingame.

1) Unzip contents into your retail dir
2) Edit toonlist.txt  ... put in your info. See toonlist for instructions.
=======NOTE: ALT-CHARS okay IN TOON NAMES now! =============
3) Drag and drop the toonlist onto Read_Toonlist.bat
4) Make hotkeynet_log.txt READ ONLY
5) Double click Hotkeynet.exe
6) Click Load Script button--Load 5mmb_HKN_<game>.txt
7) scroll lock on
8) ctrl-alt-m to login
9) When you are in, close all popups. 
10) ctrl-i to initialize all your wow buttons
12) Notice that you now have buttons that match your spec, e.g. single_fs
     It contains /click FURY_SINGLE or some such. (we will pretend you are a
fury warrior)
     NOW (classic/retail) download a cool awesome st (single target) macro from
wowlazymacros.com. Name it FURY_SINGLE.
     For WOTLK, you will open superdupermacro and create a floating macro of
the proper name, say FROST_SINGLE. That will click when you click button 2.
(don't name your macro sdf_FROST_SINGLE, even though that's the name on button
2. Drop the sdf_)
     For TBC, just replace the macros in the buttons with simple macros of
your own devising.
     That is now your macro.
     Do the same for FURY_MULTI (multiple targets, possibly at range)
     FURY_AOE (multiple targets standing on you)
     FURY_TURBO (pop all your bursts--you'll have to make this one up)
                (My turbo button always contains a mount command on ctrl key)
     FURY_SETUP (anything you want to do periodically or before a fight)
     NOTE: For wotlk/tbc I will also put macros on buttons
shift-5/shift-6/shift-7 called <spec>_AUX1/2/3. These will press at the same
time as you press 2,3,5 (all three will press).
11) Hit 0 key twice in your main window to invite/switch to free-for-all loot
(cancel raid warning dialog)
12) Interface Options--turn all action bars on.
13) alt-4 to make everyone follow
14) 2 to attack a single target. (this will only work without additional setup
in classic) F-twice to make all toons attack/talk target. (not in tbc)
15) F1-F10 heals main window then next window clockwise (set up clique heals!)
16) type /clique and go to your healers/decursers and configure which button does what when clicking on raid bars.

Retail controls are similar to classic controls here:
